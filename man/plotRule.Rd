\title{Plot a decision rule}
\usage{
plotRule(n, a1, b1, a2, b2, a = a1, b = b1, pi0 = 0.5, pi1 = 1 -
  pi0, c1 = 1, c2 = 1, c = c1/c2, rule = pi1/pi0 * c2/c1,
  sizeby = c("none", "null", "alt"), geom = c("auto", "point", "tile"))
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of trials (the same for both samples)}

\item{a1}{alpha, the hyperparameter of the prior distribution of the first poisson rate}

\item{b1}{beta, the hyperparameter of the prior distribution of the first poisson rate}

\item{a2}{alpha, the hyperparameter of the prior distribution of the second poisson rate}

\item{b2}{beta, the hyperparameter of the prior distribution of the second poisson rate}

\item{a}{alpha, the hyperparameter of the prior distribution under the null}

\item{b}{beta, the hyperparameter of the prior distribution under the null}

\item{pi0}{the prior probability of the null hypothesis}

\item{pi1}{the prior probability of the alternative hypothesis}

\item{c1}{loss associated with type I error}

\item{c2}{loss associated with type I error}

\item{c}{relative loss constant (loss due to type II error divided by loss due to type I error)}

\item{rule}{the decision rule for the Bayes factor B.  by default, test rejects when B < pi1/pi0 * c2/c1}

\item{sizeby}{size the outcomes by the probability under the null or alternative}

\item{geom}{ggplot2 geom used}
}
